    "quote": "We are the United States of America, a free society and a free nation which has been, and continues to be, along with a few other comrades-in-arms like Great Britain, the greatest force for good in the history of the world \u2014 even after you deduct our considerable mistakes and shortcomings. Through our ideas, enterprise, and generosity we have done more, in the words of Francis Bacon 'to relieve man's estate' than any other nation or people in human history. To refute this is not a sign of sophistication; it is a sign of ignorance.",

Then the edifice cracks; the mortar crumbles - one day, liberty will dawn on the other side of the wall.",

    "quote": "It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiams, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, and the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.",

# Nick's Now

## November 9, 2024

Finished reading [Circe by Madeline Miller](https://amzn.to/4fgjzhW). Excellent look into a Greek mythological character.  Odysseus plays a major role, of course.

Attended [Philly Barcamp](https://barcampphilly.org/). It was my sixt or seventh one. Really great time, and met a lot of cool people..

## October 2, 2024

Been a while. I just finished This Tender Land by William Kent Krueger. It's lovely and I recommend it.

I haven't been writing on my blog. I'm working on a side project, and when it is ready I'll let you all know about it.

Finished Boomsday. Now I'm reading [Basket Case](https://amzn.to/4bP35ej) by Carl Hiassen. It's an older one, so I'm surprised I haven't read it yet.

I ran a mile time trial, and was shocked to have run it in under 7:00. [I wrote about it](https://www.nickhodges.com/posts/2024/july/08/).

Started listening to [Boomsday by Christopher Buckley](https://amzn.to/4cQESFq). I've read him before, and his stuff is clever and laugh-out-loud funny.

About two weeks ago, I took to heart the notion that "writers write," and I started posting something every day on my blog.
Or at least I try to. I haven't missed yet. The hard part is remembering to distribute my stuff.

I have started driving for Uber. It's flexible, and I love getting paid to listen to audio books when I'm not driving someone somewhere.

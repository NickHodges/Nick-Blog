Here is a list of all the books that I have read more than once. I think that this is actually a comprehensive list. I am pretty particular about books that I will re-read. I can't think of any others that I've taken the time to read more than once. It is interesting to me that there are four Jane Austen books here. I may very well be amongst only a handful of men for which that is true. (Maybe that isn't fair -- I don't know....)

## [Lonesome Dove](https://amzn.to/3Y4Vtkv) by Larry McMurtry

I have read this book twice, and each time it had a profound effect on me. To say that this is a “sweeping epic” is to undersell it. It’s the story of two men who are among the first to lead a cattle drive from Texas to Montana, and it is just deep, moving, and powerful. It is the best book ever written in my view. (The mini-series is terrific. Robert Duvall was put on this earth to play Gus McCrae).

## [The Caine Mutiny](https://amzn.to/3W2pqPx) By Herman Wouk

The ultimate coming of age story. The Willie Keith at the beginning of the novel and the one at the end are so starkly different people that it is hard to believe. Amazing story. (Definitely do not watch the Humphrey Bogart movie, which doesn’t even remotely do this great book justice).

## [Presumed Innocent](https://amzn.to/3WnIGbP) by Scott Turow

This is an amazing legal thriller that upon additional readings gets better as you see him give subtle clues and hints as to what is going on. (The movie was okay, and I know nothing of the current TV Mini-series).

## [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://amzn.to/4cGsdFe) by Harper Lee

Not much more can be said about this definitive novel. Perhaps the most famous and widely read books in America. How many 8th graders have read this book? (One of the few case where the movie is worthy of the book).

## [Pride and Prejudice](https://amzn.to/4eXI2cb) by Jane Austen

The definitive romance novel by the OG of romance novels. (Watch the PBS/A&E mini-series, which is terrific. The guy who plays Mr. Collins gives a performance for the ages. I haven't seen the Keira Knightley movie, so I can't speak to it, but two hours seem way to short to tell this story).

## [Sense and Sensibility](https://amzn.to/3LmA8vl) by Jane Austen

Two very different sisters find what they are looking for in very different ways. (The Emma Thompson/Kate Winslet/Hugh Grant/Alan Rickman movie is very good).

## [Emma](https://amzn.to/4cYc51x) by Jane Austen

Another coming of age. Emma’s sudden realization is so great. (I enjoyed the Gwyneth Paltrow movie).

## [Persuasion](https://amzn.to/3zE8Ldz) by Jane Austen

It’s never too late. (Good movie as well. The father is terrific, and the final scene exceedingly satisfying).

## [The Pillars of the Earth](https://amzn.to/4cZosdL) by Ken Follett

First and best of a sweeping series about a cathedral in England during the Middle Ages. It is a compelling and absorbing story. (Do not watch the mini-series, which is tragically bad.)

## [The Entire Harry Potter Series](https://amzn.to/4cTLKl6) by J.K. Rowling

I'm not sure there is much that needs to be said here. Amazing series of books. Defines the Young Adult market. (The movies are fun and well done, but the books are of course much better, as is usually the case with most things).

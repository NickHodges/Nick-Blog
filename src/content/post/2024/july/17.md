## [The Knick](https://amzn.to/3YeGIeS)

I loved this show, and was sad that there were only two seasons. Fascinating premise:  The dawn of modern surgery and the modern hospital.  Clive Owen is terrific.

## [The Tudors](https://amzn.to/4bQ2SYj)

Fun way to learn the history of King Henry VIII.

## [Justified](https://amzn.to/4d6bwD2)

Off the charts good performances from Walton Goggins and Timothy Oliphant.  So good.

## [Halt and Catch Fire](https://amzn.to/3WBGZYt)

This show is FANTASTIC.  Just watch it.

## [The Americans](https://amzn.to/46aN6WH)

Criminally underwatched.  Great story, with amazing plot twists and cliffhangers.  As an Intel officer in the 80’s, this one is particularly of interest to me.  Amazing ending.

Oh man, the performances here are off the charts.  And the tie-ins to the original movie are fun.

## [For All Mankind](https://amzn.to/467j1Hm)

Love the intriguing notion here — what would have happened if the Russians had beaten us to the moon in 1969? Very well done.

Fun show with great characters. The 30 minute episodes makes it easier to watch.

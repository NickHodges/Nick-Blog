I have a "quick to subsribe, quick to unsubscribe" policy. This applies to Twitter, podcasts, newsletters, etc.  Here are five newsletters that have survived that policy and that I read every time they hit my inbox.

## [Sahil Bloom](https://sparklp.co/464d61cc/)

This guy is totally precocious.  Despite only being in his early 30s, Sahil’s newsletters are consistently full of sagely wisdom about life.  Never not good.

## [Six at 6 by Billy Oppenheimer](https://billyoppenheimer.com/newsletter/)

Another consistently great newsletter by another precocious young man.  Billy is [Ryan Holiday’s](https://ryanholiday.net/) research assistant. I have no idea how he consistently produces an insightful and delightful newsletter every Sunday. He must read like a librarian on speed. Added bonus: He's a very nice guy.

## [TLDR](https://refer.tldr.tech/08876c8c/)

This is the flagship newsletter of a collection of newsletters that do a great job of summarizing the tech world each day.  I also read the [TLDR WebDev](https://refer.tldr.tech/0e805346/3) and [TLDR Crypto](https://refer.tldr.tech/33f31452/6) newsletters.

## [Recommendo](https://www.recomendo.com/)

Each week a small group of folks led by the most interesting  man in the internet, [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org), recommend all manner of things ranging from products to websites to books. I never fail to find all kinds of off-beat and interesting stuff.

## [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/subscribe)

A delightful look at the world by a guy named [Jono Hey](https://www.jonohey.com/). He has mastered the art of illustrating almost any concept in simple yet lovely drawings. I also recommend his [new book "Big Ideas Little Pictures](https://amzn.to/3XUUB1Y) which is a collection of his drawings. I really enjoy how he can make stick figures look so expressive.

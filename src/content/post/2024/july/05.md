Today would have been my mighty mom’s 89th Birthday.

My mom was, as all moms are, wonderful and she lived an amazing life. I miss her, especially today.

She accomplished a great many things, one of which was deeply researching and writing two novels set in World War II. The publishing industry didn’t see fit to ever publish them, so I [took things into my own hands and did so](https://amzn.to/3L8VlJf) just before she passed.

So in her memory, today I’d like to ask you to consider reading my mom’s novel. You can read [the story of how it was written and published here](https://www.thatmadgame.com/about). I’d be delighted if you choose to buy it, but you can get a free copy if you promise to read it and write an Amazon review. Everything you need is at https://thatmadgame.com

And please let me know if you find any typos in the book or any problems with the website.

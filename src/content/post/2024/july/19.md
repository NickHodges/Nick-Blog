A couple of weeks ago, I went to the Brooks and Dunn concert. They were great. Opening for them was a guy named David Lee Murphy, and he was very good as well.

I looked Mr. Murphy up and it turns out that not only is he an accomplished performer, but he’s a prolific song writer. He’s written hundreds of songs for other artists, including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, and Keith Urban. Songs apparently just flow out of the guy.

Now I mention this because I know someone like that — my youngest daughter. Now, granted, I am really biased, but she is a brilliant and talented songwriter. Songs flow out of her like water from a mountain stream. They come effortlessly and beautifully to her, and I never ceased to be amazed at how she can produce and endless stream of amazing and profound songs.

[So I’d be honored if you’d give her music a listen and her art a look](https://www.waltzy777.com/). She goes by the stage name “Waltzy”.

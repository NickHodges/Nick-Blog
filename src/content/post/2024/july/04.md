Last year I [posted about what I try to remember every year on the Fourth](https://www.nickhodges.com/posts/tryingtoremember/).

This year, I’m remembering how we, as an American people, have shown some terrific resilience over the years.

We’ve survived the Civil War, the Great Depression and various other financial crises, two World Wars, pandemics, and numerous terrorist attacks.  We’ve made it through contentious elections, natural disasters, assassinations, as well as many predicted calamities that never actually came true.

And I think we’ll survive and thrive in this strange time we find ourselves in now.

So on today of all days, remember that. And while you are at it, cut that neighbor with the political lawn side that you don’t like a little slack.  After all, it's a free country.

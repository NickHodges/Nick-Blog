Three movies you may not have seen and will probably like:

1. [Crossing Delancy](https://amzn.to/4cmS3hh) — I love this movie so much it hurts.
2. [I’m Reed Fish](https://amzn.to/3zpctI2) — Quirky and fun with an interesting twist.
3. [About Time](https://amzn.to/3WeB37z) — I’m a sucker for a time travel movie, and this is a very good one.

And I just realized that all three of these are romantic comedies. Interesting.

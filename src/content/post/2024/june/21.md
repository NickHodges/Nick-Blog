Here are three books that I think you should read:

- [**The Caine Mutiny**](https://amzn.to/3xotBNr) by [Herman Wouk](https://amzn.to/4bja4Ma)
  - The ultimate coming of age story.
- [**A Gentleman in Moscow**](https://amzn.to/3KQB8Ym) by [Amor Towles](https://amzn.to/4epRd4O)
  - Just a beautiful, lovely book. A story of resilience and grace.
- [**Lonesome Dove**](https://amzn.to/4c7kfF1) by [Larry McMurtry](https://amzn.to/45BMtoX)
  - A profound epic story of everything that it means to be human and alive. I walked around like a zombie for a week after reading this book.

I haven't cracked the spine of an actual book in months and months, but I've "read" many books in the mean time.

Well, that's not actually true. I have read a ton of books, but the only physical books that I've read have been non-fiction books. Instead of reading physical novels, I've "read" many novels as audiobooks.

I spend a lot of time in my car, and it's great to listen to audio books while I'm driving. Sometimes I get an hour at a time, but maybe it is only ten minutes. Either way, I'm turning on whatever book I'm listening to. I find that novels lend themselves to listening better than non-fiction books do.

Here are some thoughts that I have about audiobooks:

- As noted, I “read” (I keep using the quotes because do you actually read an audiobook?”) only novels as audiobooks. I almost always have a non-fiction, physical book going as well.

- I find that I enjoy a book more when it is read to me. Maybe it hearkens back to my mom, who read to me tirelessly when I was a kid, but the whole experience is just more enjoyable..
- Who and how the book is narrated is critical. Most of the narrators are good, and some are really good. For instance, the lovely and talented [Marin Ireland](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1677477/) narrates the [Beartown series](https://amzn.to/3XpGils), and she is brilliant. The books are amazing, but her performance enhances the experience beyond the mere reading of the books.
- Sometimes the narrator choice is cool. [Titus Welliver](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920038/) played Harry Bosch in the TV series for [Michael Connelly’s books](https://amzn.to/3KBB5iS), and he narrates the audiobooks. I like that.
- Some books have multiple narrators, which is kind of cool. Often, a book will have different sections, told from differing points of view, and they will choose narrators based on sex and accent.

* I’m surprised that they don’t dramatize the book more — having a narrator to read the exposition, and different characters do the voices for different people in the book, kind of like a radio show. I suspect that this will happen.
* Occasionally, I’ll pick a book, and the narrator will be so unappealing that I’ll stop reading and move on.
* I still occasionally will refer to “books on tape” instead of saying “audiobooks”. I’m old.
* I get most of my audiobooks from the library via the [Libby app](https://meet.libbyapp.com/). Free is my favorite price. I also use [Google Rewards](https://googleopinionrewardsrefer.page.link/9dT8MGnRXCzwn2tN8) to earn credit to buy books from [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books).

In the end, I have “read” way more books than I otherwise would have as a result of the rise of audiobooks. This makes me happy.

I, like pretty much everyone, love music.  I’m a huge fan of Spotify (even if their application leaves much to be desired…)

And of course, there are some artists that truly resonate with me, and I realized that there are actually a few of them that I like so much that I literally love every single song they play.  And not only that, I am unable to conceive of them producing a song that I don’t actually like.

Those artists are:

1. [Mat Kearney](https://amzn.to/3XDXyUl)
2. [Sam Hunt](https://amzn.to/3RGMrpX)
3. [Bruce Springsteen](https://amzn.to/3KZ5CHS)
4. [Patty Griffin](https://amzn.to/4bpi6TD)


:::success[Not on the list]

Interestingly, while I loves me some Taylor Swift, and while I have been a Swiftie since around 2007, long before many of you all had ever heard of her, she is not on this list.  There are some of her songs that I don’t like that much, mostly from around 2014 - 2016.  Not sure why.

Now I like a lot of other artists, but these four are, for reasons I’m not at all clear about, the ones that somehow click with me like no others do.

## Why We Built Respectify (and Why We’d Love Your Feedback)

Ever since I started writing, coding, and thinking out loud on this blog, one thing has been clear: the internet is an incredible place *and* a messy one. We’ve got forums and communities and debates happening all over the world, and yet so much of that energy gets lost in noise — trolls, pointless comments, insults, logical misfires, and just plain chaos.

Shoot, [I wrote this a while back](https://www.nickhodges.com/posts/argueoninternet/).

That’s why David Millington and I built **[Respectify](https://respectify.ai)**.

David and I have spent a lot of time thinking and talking about how online spaces *should* work. We’re not naïve — we know human discourse can be messy — but we also know it can be thoughtful, enlightening, and genuinely useful. We wanted a tool that helps bring out the best of what online conversation can be rather than amplifying the worst.

### So What Does Respectify Do?

Respectify is an AI‑powered moderation tool that goes beyond simple profanity filters or keyword blocks. It’s built to understand the *quality* of what people are saying:

- It spots logical fallacies and points them out.
- It flags insults and unproductive rants.
- It identifies low‑value or off‑topic comments that don’t add to the discussion.
- It suggests ways to improve comments, helping people learn how to make better arguments and clearer points.

The idea isn’t censorship. It’s *quality amplification*. It’s giving communities the tools to raise the signal and reduce the static.

### Why We Care

We built Respectify because we want the web to be a place where real exchange and real learning can happen — not just shouting matches and drive‑bys. This is a tool for bloggers, forum hosts, community builders, and anyone who actually *cares* about the conversations happening on their site.

There’s a lot more we want to do with Respectify, and that’s where you come in.

### We’d Love Your Feedback

You can try Respectify yourself at https://demo.respectify.ai — it’s free and open for you to play with. Try it on comments you care about. See how it scores logic, identifies issues, and offers suggestions.

And if you have thoughts — about what it gets right, where it misses the mark, or what would make it more useful — we want to hear from you. Feedback is how we make this better for everyone.

Thanks for reading, and here’s to better, richer,and politer online discussion.

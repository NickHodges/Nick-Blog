description: 'An interesting t-shirt at a George Strait concert.'

:::success[Added on June 11, 2024]
Someone whose opinion is very important to me pointed out that I might have been unclear about my view of the shirt. I don't think that the shirt is a bad thing, and I don't think that the people wearing it are bad people. And I don't want to paint George Strait fans in a negative light. Far from it. I personally don't think flag-stomping is a worthy endeavor, but I'm glad that we live in a country where you can stomp on the flag and not get thrown in jail.

I was at the George Strait concert last night, and within easy view of me were not one but two young men who had on the back of their t-shirts an American flag with the words “Stomp this flag and I’ll stomp your ass!” on them. Now, this isn’t really a surprise at a George Strait concert (not a comment at all about George Strait himself, who is, from all accounts, a fine person. And it was a terrific concert…), but it did get me thinking.

First, I’m 100% sure that no one wants to stomp on a flag emblazoned across the back of another person’s t-shirt. So the challenge doens't make sense to me. Whatever.

But second, while I guess I pretty much get the sentiment of the shirt, I myself would want a shirt that said

_"While I would prefer you not stomp on this particular flag, or any flag for that matter, as an American, I fully support your right to stomp on your own flag. After all, it’s a free country.”_

I searched the internet, and I couldn’t find a shirt that said that.

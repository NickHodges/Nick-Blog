The minimum wage is a great example of an issue where it's proponents only see the upsides and refuse to even acknowledge a downside.

I oppose it for two main reasons:

1. It doesn't allow for freedom for employers and employees to enter into agreements willingly.
2. It prevents low-skilled people from getting jobs that they might otherwise get.

You see, one of the downsides of the minimum wage is that is a barrier to entry for very low skilled people. I prefer for very low-skilled people to accept low paying jobs. By insisting on a minimum wage, society causes people to not have jobs that otherwise would have. I prefer that very low skilled people have jobs as opposed to not having them. When advocating for the minimum wage, people fail to realize the harm they do to people who can't get jobs.

I care about poor people, and want them to be able to get a start somewhere. I oppose policies that hold poor people back.

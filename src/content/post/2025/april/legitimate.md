**Dear Left of Center People**: Being concerned about voter fraud, the integrity of the ballot box, and making sure only citizens vote are legitimate concerns.

**Dear Right of Center People**: Being concerned about voter suppression, the integrity of the ballot box, and making sure everyone can vote are legitimate concerns.

**Dear Left of Center People**:  Wanting people to have to show ID to vote is a legitimate and reasonable position to hold.

**Dear Right of Center People**:  Being concerned that people don't have ID and thus can't vote is a legitimate and reasonable position to hold.

**Dear Left of Center People**:  Wanting to ensure the integrity of the ballot box is not a racist position..

**Dear Right of Center People**:  Being concerned about voter suppression, particularly in minority communities is a legitimate concern based on long history.

Okay, so, given all that, I think we should apply the ancient, long forgotten art of compromise to this issue. I know, I know, it's a radical idea, but hear me out.

How about we have a system that requires proper ID for voting, but that makes it easy to get that ID?  How about we all agree that we make it easy for people to identify themselves, and easy for citizens -- and only citizens -- vote?

You know -- recognized all the legitimate concerns and compromise.

What a nutty idea.

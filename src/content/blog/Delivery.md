---

A few nights a week, I deliver pizzas. I love it. It puts extra bucks in my pocket, it gets me out of the house, and the place I deliver for -- ([Mike's Pizza](http://www.mikespizzashoppe.com/)) -- is a great family run place. Often, I feel like Santa Claus when a kid yells "Pizza's here!!" It is also surprisingly good money.

I used to deliver DoorDash, but I really didn't like that, mainly because it was sporadic, and often dragged me half way across the state. (And don't get me started on them dinging my delivery record for saying I didn't make a delivery, despite me sending them clear, irrefutable video evidence that I did in fact make the delivery...) Delivering for Mike's means I never go more than three or four miles away from the store. It's great. I really like it.

I've never had a bad experience with a customer. Everyone is always pleasant. But I have spent more than a few deliveries wondering where the customer's door is. Apartment complexes are usually the worst, often leaving me wondering what sick, twisted mind designed the numbering patterns for the buildings.

Here are some things you can do to make life easier for your friendly neighborhood delivery person:

- The number one thing you can do to be a good delivery customer is to provide clear house numbers. They should be prominent, reflective, and obvious. They should be on your mailbox and right by your door. Most of the hassle I have is finding the right driveway and door. I would think you'd want this so that the police and fire departments could find you quickly. I'm kind of surprised at how many residences for which this isn't true.
- Turn on the porch light. Please. Approaching a darkened house is fraught with peril if your sidewalk is poorly lit, especially in bad weather.
- If you have a storm door, leave your inner door open. This helps me know that you are expecting me and that I am in the right place
- Have a prominent door bell that works. Google Nest or Amazon Ring doorbells are great. Make sure that if I ring the bell, I can hear that it rang so I know that you have a chance at hearing it.
- While I'm grateful for any and all tips, cash tips are vastly preferable to tips on the credit card.
- I don't mind your dog. In fact, if he's friendly, I'd love to pet him. But if the dog growls, please just tell me to leave the food on the stoop.
- Some minor points:
  - If you are expecting a delivery, be ready to answer the phone from a strange number. Sometimes I have to call to get help finding the right door, and if you don't answer, I can't find you.
  - If I am delivering food to your party, please remember that I'm coming and listen for the ring or know. More than once I've been standing there banging on the door while you all are listening to music and talking, utterly oblivious to my presence.
  - Sometimes, Google Maps is utterly wrong. If you know this about your address, please let us know and provide a bit of guidance to the persons taking your order.

Just a few thoughts that may not have occurred to you.

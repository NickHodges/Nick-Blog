Below is some wisdom I have collected over the years. I intend to keep updating this as time goes on and things occur to me.

1. Never refuse a breath mint.
2. The ability to accept that you might be wrong and that you actually are wrong is a sign of strength and maturity.
3. Sometimes quitting is the smartest and wisest decision you can make.
4. If you want to be respected, you need to make sure that you are respectable.
5. As a general rule, you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want as long as you don't force yourself on anyone.
6. Don't think you can't. There are precious few things in life that you **must** do.
7. If you can't figure out what to do think "What would I tell my very best friend to do here?"
8. Your life will go a whole lot better once you realize that you are responsible for all your problems, and that other people are not. You have to deal with everything that comes at you, and how you deal with it is how it will go.
9. One should always seek to understand more than seek to be understood.
10.

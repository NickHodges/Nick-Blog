Let's say there are 1 billion internet users every day -- probably a conservative number.

Let's say that each of them has to click on those infernal cookie banners three times a day, and that each one takes one second.

That is three billion seconds utterly wasted every day.

Three billion seconds is 833,333 hours and 20 minutes. That is 3.98 person years.

So every day, the EU wastes almost 4 person years. Every. Single. Day.

Fuck you, GDPR.

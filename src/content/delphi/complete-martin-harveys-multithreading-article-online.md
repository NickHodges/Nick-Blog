Threading in Delphi, or in any other tool for that matter, is difficult.  There are a lot of good resources out there for Delphi developers, but perhaps none better than Martin Harvey’s “Multi-threading: The Delphi Way”.  There is a copy of it here --  [http://thaddy.co.uk/threads/](http://thaddy.co.uk/threads/) – but sadly it doesn’t include the graphics and the code.  

Well, I was working on the TThread chapter for my new book, and guess what I happened across on my hard drive?  The entire copy of Harvey’s work, including the graphics and the code samples.  I have no idea how I came to have it, but I do.  I thought it would be worth posting in its entirety, so I did:

It’s all there – graphics, code samples, and text.  I hope I’m not violating any intellectual property rights in posting it.  I certainly am grateful to Mr. Harvey for his work.  If I am doing wrong here, please let me know and I’ll take it down. I’d hate to have to do that, though.  

Otherwise, there it is as a valuable resource for the Delphi community.  I hope it is helpful to someone.

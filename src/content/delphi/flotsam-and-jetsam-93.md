- In [my post](http://www.codingindelphi.com/blog/more-coding-in-delphi/) about my [new book](https://leanpub.com/morecodingindelphi), I mentioned that I thought my outline was a little thin, and indeed it was.  I left out a large topic about which I planned on writing – “Writing SOLID Code”.  Add that in, and things seem a bit more fleshed out.  The silly thing was that I was working on that chapter when I put together the outline and wrote the blog post.  Anyway, the outline has been updated and all is well.  Thanks again for the support.  If you want to keep up with the book’s progress, help out answering my silly questions, and generally be supportive, you can sign up at the [LeanPub site](https://leanpub.com/morecodingindelphi/), or you can [join the Google Group](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110978417023349293804).  - Here’s some food for thought for [my post about not using nil](http://www.codingindelphi.com/blog/on-the-use-and-acceptance-of-nil/) – [The Null Object Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern).  Yet another reason never to return nil.  Instead of doing that, you can return a null object that won’t cause an access violation and yet won’t do anything.  You can check if the object is a null object if you need to.  Win all around.- So the rumors were true – [Embarcadero has bought the main products of TwoDesk Software](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/123132).  Jacob Thurman has stated that while he’s not now an Embarcadero employee, he will be working on the Delphi IDE.  I guess it’s none of our business exactly what the relationship will be, but if Jacob is working to improve what the IDE can do with code and to improve developer productivity in the Code Editor, I’m very happy.  I know that Jacob has had a lot of things that he wanted to do, but found it difficult as an “outsider”.  Now that he’s an “insider”, I hope he can do them.  I think we’ll see some fun stuff coming out of this deal. Congratulations to Jacob, who I hope was well remunerated, and to Embarcadero for the wisdom to see and acquire Jacob’s skills.- True words tweeted by me: “[There are two things that developers love to do: Make pronouncements, and point out the exceptions to other developers' pronouncements](https://twitter.com/NickHodges/status/557995152778993666)*.*”  I like to make pronouncements as you’ve probably noted.  I’m always trying to learn new things and new ways of doing things, and I don’t want to be held back by the “well, we’ve always done it that way” way of thinking.  I believe that the way software is developed is evolving and improving, and that we’ve found new ways of doing things better.  I try to learn those things and blog about them.  That’s what I’m trying to do here.  If you disagree with what I say, I welcome your comments. But I ask you to consider that maybe I’m actually on to something.  I’d encourage you to take the same path I have – the path of learning these new things that developers are finding and doing.  For instance, I don’t ever intend on writing another Delphi application without utilizing MVVM.  But ten years ago, such a thought would have occurred to almost no Delphi developer.  I encourage you to study the SOLID principles, to read [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=nickhodgeshomepa&linkId=YUHVKTWLEPEZBAS3)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nickhodgeshomepa&l=as2&o=1&a=0132350882), to find better ways to decouple your code, and to generally seek out new thinking about software development.  I’m a firm believer that there is always a better way, and I encourage you to think so as well.

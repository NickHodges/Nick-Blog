- [The Starter Version of Delphi is currently 100% off.  I.e.  Free as in beer.](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/promotional-download)- “*The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourselves in code*.” - Uncle Bob Martin- I continue working hard on my materials for [Delphi Developer Days](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/).  If you [haven’t signed up yet, do it](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/#price-reg).  I’m really looking forward to seeing you all there. - I’m really looking forward to attending [TechBash 2016](http://techbash.com/) at the end of the month here in the Poconos in Pennsylvania.  Not only will there be a great lineup of speakers and a great venue, there will be some old friends there that I’m looking forward to seeing again.  It’s nice to have a world-class event like this so close to where I live – it’s so close that I’m driving, as well as taking advantage of the water park.  :-)- And while we are on the topic of conferences, I’ll be at Philly CodeCamp this year as well, on October 21-22.  It’s at the Microsoft Malvern office.  Friday is a pay-for-it all day session, where Saturday is hour long talks and is totally free.  If you are in the area, you should go.  It’s always been very good, and they give away a lot of prizes.- The new book is drawing closer.  I know I keep saying that, but I only so because it is true.  It will finish sooner rather than later.  [As always, you can sign up to  be kept abreast of things](https://leanpub.com/dependencyinjectionindelphi).

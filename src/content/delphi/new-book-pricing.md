Hey, folks, I have some good news -- I've dropped the prices on my books all across the board.

[This post from a few months ago has been updated with the new pricing](http://www.codingindelphi.com/blog/how-to-buy-my-books/).

A few things to note:

 	- I'm giving dollar prices here, but the prices have also been lowered for Euros and British Pounds on Amazon.
 	- CreateSpace no longer appears to sell books directly, so I removed those links.
 	- [*Coding in Delphi*](http://amzn.to/2vQr4Hx)'s price doesn't appear to have updated right away on Amazon.  The new price is **$24.99**. Hopefully it will update soon.
 	- [*More Coding in Delphi*](http://amzn.to/2wag7Do) is now** $29.99**
 	- [*Dependency Injection in Delphi*](http://amzn.to/2fRlzEI) is now **$19.99**
 	- [*The Coding in Delphi Bundle*](https://leanpub.com/b/codingindelphibundle) on LeanPub is now **$39.99**
 	- [*The Nick's Delphi Book Bundle*](https://leanpub.com/b/nicksdelphibookbundle) on LeanPub is now **$49.99**

These are not temporary price drops -- they are permanent.

As always, I am very grateful to everyone who has and will buy my books.

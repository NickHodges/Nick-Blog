- Someone finally wised up and [wrote a FireMonkey book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VPC7V86).  I gather its in [German](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00UW51PPC) as well as English.  The march of Delphi books continues. This is good news.  - I now am the proud owner of a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.  What should I do with it? Currently it is merely acting as network storage.- Jeff Weir is running a poll:  [Do you give Embarcadero a thumbs up or a thumbs down since they’ve taken over CodeGear?](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+jeffweir/posts/6RpXzKJMWtg?cfem=1)  I voted “Thumbs Up!”  No surprise there, I suppose.- Probably the best part of reading the [Martin Fowler Refactoring book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201485672&linkCode=as2&tag=nickhodgeshomepa&linkId=EQ7J5GX7V3WNLEWP) is that it actually shows you how to do things right the first time. - This is interesting.  [Microsoft is apparently creating an LLVM-based compiler for .Net](http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-April/084459.html).

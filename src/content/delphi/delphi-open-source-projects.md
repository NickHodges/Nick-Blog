This page is a listing of a number of high quality Delphi Open Source Projects.

The projects listed on this page are:

- Vetted and looked at by me and deemed "worthy" of being here.  I'm happy to take recommendations for listing.  I'll try not to be too snooty about it, but I don't want to list every single project out there -- there has to be ***some*** minimum standard, right?
- Available for download via either Subversion (svn) or Mercurial (hg) or another popular open source SCM tool.

If you know if a good, well-maintained, and useful library that deserves to be here, let me know.

Project Name Short Description 

[Delphi Spring Framework](http://code.google.com/p/delphi-spring-framework/)
A Delphi version of the well known Java Spring Framework.  It includes a Dependency Injection framework, a lovely set of generic collections, encryption libraries, and more.

[Internet Direct](http://www.indyproject.org/Sockets/Download/svn.EN)
Indy is a complete socket library for building clients and servers using the standard Internet protocols

[Delphi Relax](http://code.marcocantu.com/p/delphirelax/source/tree/HEAD/)

[DUnitX Testing Framework](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX)
A new, more modern unit testing framework for Delphi

[Emballo](http://code.google.com/p/emballo/)

Though not currently maintained, I'm including it here anyway.  This is a lovely library, including a Dependency Injection Container and a Mock library, as well as the ability to bind a DLL to an interface.  The community would do well to figure out a way to get this project going again.

A complete mocking framework for Delphi that makes building mock objects drop dead simple.  

[Delphi Sorcery](http://code.google.com/p/delphisorcery/)

A very nice, powerful framework for Delphi providing data-binding, a dependency injection container, an MVVM framework, a mock object, and more.

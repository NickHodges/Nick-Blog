- Been a while, eh?  - Obviously the biggest news to cover is the Idera acquisition.  By now I’m sure you all are aware that [Idera Software](https://www.idera.com/) has acquired Embarcadero. (It always seems strange to me when a smaller company bys a bigger one, but never mind….)  They’ve done an interesting thing.  They’ve taken the Embarcadero database tools (what we used to call “DataGear”) and incorporated them into Idera’s software brand.  Then, they’ve left RAD Studio and Interbase under the Embarcadero banner as a separate entity.  I don’t know what the accounting setup is, but it does seem like a separate company altogether.  Neither website mentions the other.  [Embarcadero put out a press release](http://www.embarcadero.com/united-states/embarcadero-announces-dedicated-developer-strategy) stating that they are exclusively focused on development tools, which I really liked to see.  It does seem like Idera wanted the “DataGear” stuff and have now set up “CodeGear” as a separate entity.  What that means I don’t know. But here’s to continued success under the new management.- Along those lines, I did have a conversation with [Atanas Popov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atanaspopov), General Manager for Embarcadero. He was quite confident in things going well as they execute on the roadmap.  He’s actually quite open and accessible – he publishes his email: [atanas.popov@idera.com](mailto:atanas.popov@idera.com)  Don’t be afraid to get in touch with him if you have any questions or issues about the path forward.-  I can’t vouch for the book, but you can get [Delphi Succinctly for free](http://syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/details/ebooks/delphi?utm_medium=2016ebookedm&utm_campaign=website&utm_source=sendgrid&utm_medium=bigdataedm).- I will be presenting two days of material at the [Danish Delphi User Group](http://www.dapug.dk/) at the end of April.  I’m really looking forward to it, not only for the excellent conference, but also because my youngest will be making the trip with me.  I’ve talked at this conference twice before, and it’s always been fun.  If you are in thearea and want to excellent Delphi content (if I do say so myself), then you should attend. - My books continue to sell, and I’m very grateful to each and everyone of you that have made a purchase.  If you still want to buy, supplies are unlimited, but don’t let that stop you!  You can [buy](http://amzn.to/1RsP3yk) both [books](http://amzn.to/1pAoXmZ) in paper copy, [both on](https://leanpub.com/codingindelphi)  [electronic copy](https://leanpub.com/morecodingindelphi) from LeanPub, and if you are really excited, you can buy them both as [an electronic bundle for a $15 savings](https://leanpub.com/b/codingindelphibundle).  Again, you have my thanks and gratitude for your purchases.  The books have been way more successful than I ever hoped. - The bummer news is, of course, the departure of [Allen Bauer](http://blog.therealoracleatdelphi.com/) from Embarcadero. Allen is a great friend, and I wish him well on his new endeavors at Google. He was with the Delphi team from the very beginnning.  His loss is a blow to the product.  But the team isn’t just one guy, so here’s to others stepping up to fill the void.  - **Link of the Week:  [Giving up on TDD](http://bit.ly/1T0NPjd)** by Uncle Bob.  Apparently a guy named Ian Sommerville [“gave up” on TDD](http://iansommerville.com/systems-software-and-technology/giving-up-on-test-first-development/), and Uncle Bob refutes his argument. Uncle Bob doesn’t pull his punches.  Good stuff.

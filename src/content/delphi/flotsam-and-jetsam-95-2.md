- **Quote of the Week: **["In general, you should always strive to eliminate the passing of null rather than checking for null."](http://elegantcode.com/2010/05/01/say-no-to-null/) – John Sonmez-  #DelphiWeek was fun.  [I followed the hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DelphiWeek),  and saw all kinds of fun stuff, from people posting pictures of their old versions of Delphi (all the way back to floppies that held the very early versions of the beta.  I still have some of those --) to [Ray Konopka’s Borcon buttons](https://twitter.com/RayKonopka/status/566350387968348160).  I was also honored to be interviewed for the event, talking about the early days of [TSmiley](http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/2010/01/06/39345) and something I’m still proud of to this day – the fact that I was at the original launch event for Delphi.  It’s hard to believe that as I type this, that was twenty years ago today, but there you have it.  Delphi really is twenty years of continuous innovation, and it continues to prove worthy of that moniker.  - Rob Love has a really nice article [on the Parallel Programming Library and using TTask properly](http://robstechcorner.blogspot.com/2015/02/tpl-ttask-example-in-how-not-to-use.html).  Good example of how tricky parallel programming can be.  I’m working on that chapter for my new book and it is indeed a challenging topic, but one worth the effort.  Good reason to upgrade to XE7.- Andy Hausladen dog-fooded [a new JSON parser for Delphi](http://andy.jgknet.de/blog/2015/02/json-parser-jsondataobjects-is-now-on-github/).  Worth a look, for sure.  I downloaded it, looked at the unit tests, and now I know how to use it.  See?  it really works that way.

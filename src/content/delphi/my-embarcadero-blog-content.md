While I was at Embarcadero, I started a series on what I considered "Pretty Good Development Practices".  Sadly, my tenure ended before I could continue the series further.  Then, mystifyingly, Embarcadero shut down my blog, making all my content unaccessible except via the wonders of the Google Cache. Actually, now it seems that[ my old blog is back up and running](http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges).  Yay!  Well, there was a lot of good content on my blog, if I do say so myself, and so I'm trying to capture as much of it as I can and republish it here.  I've grabbed all the "Delphi Pretty Good Practices" series and the "Fun with Testing DateUtils.pas" series as well.  I'll reformat and republish that content here.  Sadly, I'm not really able to reproduce the great comments that you all left, but I'll try to reference the Google Cache versions which have them.  (How long does a page stay in the Google Cache -- forever?).  Below, then, is an index to as much of my old stuff as I could find/pull together.  If you have any requests, please remind me, and I'll track it down:

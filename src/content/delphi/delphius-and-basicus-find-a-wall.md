Delphius and Basicus were walking down a path.  Delphius was a wise software developer with many years of experience.  Basicus, Delphius’ student, had some experience as well, but lacked wisdom and often made foolish errors.

As the two were walking, they came upon a wall blocking the path.  The wall was made of stone and was not high – it could be easily climbed over -- and not wide, the brush on either side could be easily walked through. 

“What a stupid place for a wall!” exclaimed Basicus.

Delphius considered the wall.  

“Clearly someone put this wall here on purpose,” he said.

Basicus scowled.  “Why would anyone be so dumb as to put a wall in the middle of a path?”

“At the moment I do not know,” replied Delphius.

“I say tear it down!” Basicus cried out.

“One must be very sure about tearing down a wall so carefully constructed,” replied Delphius.  He walked around the wall, through the brush, and on to the path on the other side.

Basicus reluctantly followed.

My deal with Embarcadero has expired, so [More Coding in Delphi is now available for sale in electronic form](https://leanpub.com/morecodingindelphi).  

That makes a total of four ways to buy my two books:

- You can buy *More Coding in Delphi* in [paperback](https://www.createspace.com/5598794) or [electronic form](https://leanpub.com/morecodingindelphi)- You can still get *Coding in Delphi* in [paperback](https://www.createspace.com/4584226) or [electronic form](https://leanpub.com/codingindelphi).
Both books are also [available on Amazon](http://amzn.to/1jHCgOI).  

Both books have been more successful than I could have hoped for, and I’m very grateful to all of you that have purchased.  I hope you are pleased with it.

- I mentioned this video before, but it is so good I’m going to mention it again:  [Parallel Programming Library: Create Responsive Object Pascal Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZfux4by0po&list=PLwUPJvR9mZHhgQYWWgF6BCkgDwIpP78ZV).   Danny’s blog is in Dutch, but he has [an English entry that includes the source code to his session](http://dannywind.nl/delphi/coderage9/).- **Something I’m surprised by**:  The number of questions on [the Delphi StackOverflow tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/delphi) that deal with integrating with Excel.  Also, tons of Indy questions.- This is interesting: [Jon Aasenden](http://jonlennartaasenden.wordpress.com) is creating [DelphiArmy](http://jonlennartaasenden.wordpress.com/2014/12/16/delphiarmy-com-is-now-a-reality/) – a real, no kidding jobsite for Delphi developers.  I’ll be interested to see how that goes.  It [appears to be alive and running](http://www.delphiarmy.com/), so make an entry if you need to.- I’ve mentioned free this tool before, but its usefulness is so awesome that I wanted to point it out again.  It’s called “[Everything](http://www.voidtools.com/)”, and it allows you to search for any file by name on your entire system.  It’s lightening fast, and I use it probably twenty times a day to find things I’m looking for.  It’s one of the first things I install on a new system.  Truly outstanding and amazingly useful.  Highly recommended.  - While I’m at this “mentioning before” thing, I’ll give a strong endorsement to the Delphi-built [Clipmate](http://www.clipmate.com/). Again, I use this thing about 25 times a day.  It’s a clipboard cache that remembers what you’ve put on the clipboard.  It’s not free – but it’s well worth the price.  Saved my butt a thousand times, too, when I overwrite something on the clipboard that I didn’t want to.

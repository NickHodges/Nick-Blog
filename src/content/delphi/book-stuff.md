As always, I'm very grateful to all of you who buy my books.  Thank you.

But here's something interesting about my books:  [Coding in Delphi](https://amzn.to/3dCmUet) sells more than [More Coding in Delphi](https://amzn.to/2ZzY9Y0) and [Dependency Injection in Delphi](https://amzn.to/3pB4lcU).

That means that there are many of you out there who have bought one of my books, but not the others. Now, maybe you guys buy Coding in Delphi, don't like it, and then never come back for more.  Fair enough.

But I'm wondering if it's because you just don't know that the other two books exist?

I'm no marketing expert -- that's clear -- but I'm not above posting a blog entry shamelessly pointing out that I have two other books and that I think you should buy them.  ;-)

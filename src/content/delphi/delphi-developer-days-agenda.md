Hey, I’m pretty psyched to do Delphi Developer Days this year.  I always love to travel, and I always love to talk about Delphi, and getting to do both at the same time is pretty great.  

If you haven’t heard, our agenda is out.  [We have a general schedule and a description of the presentations](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/descriptions.html).

We’ll be presenting in:

- [Chicago on November 14 - 15](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/chicago.html)- [Copenhagen on November 24 - 25](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/copenhagen.html)- [Frankfurt on November 28 - 29](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/frankfurt.html)- [Baltimore on December 5 – 6](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/bwi.html) 
Cary and I will be doing some of the presentations together, and we’ll also break out for separate sessions.  I’m going to be talking about Patterns in Delphi, Unit Testing, and Advanced Language Features.  We’ll also be covering the Debugger, Parallel Programming, and many other interesting topics.

In addition, Marco Cantu will be giving the keynote via Skype and will be available for questions.  

[Sign up now as space is limited at each venue](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/). You can also get the early-bird special if you sign up today.   I’d love to see you there.

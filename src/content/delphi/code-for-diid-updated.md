***UPDATED**:  I see now that my friend Kirk Halgren is the mystery man.  Thanks, Kirk!*

Thanks to the comment of a generous reader -- whom I am ashamed to say I can't remember -- I have updated the code for Dependency Injection in Delphi to remove all the uses of the GlobalContainer.  

The book removed it all, but I failed to properly update the repository.

You can get the corrected code on [BitBucket](http://bit.ly/diidcode).

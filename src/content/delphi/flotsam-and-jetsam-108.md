- It’s Delphi Survey time.  [You can take it here](http://surveymonkey.com/r/FGCCYNY).  I can assure you from personal experience that the results of the survey have a big impact on the future direction of the product, so please take the time to fill it out as completely as possible.  I think it is only out for a limited time –until the 28th if my math is correct --  so do it right now. - I was stunned to discover that Visual Studio Code didn’t syntax highlight *.pas files.  Wow.  So here’s a couple of things.  First, [vote here on UserVoice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code/suggestions/7760700-support-pascal-files) for this entry that asks for Object Pascal support.  At that [link I found this link](https://github.com/Wosi/vs.language.objectpascal), which is an unofficial project to add support.  It seems to work – and I appreciate the effort from [Wosi](https://github.com/Wosi) --  but I find it ridiculous that VS Code doesn’t support Pascal out of the box.- Looks like the next release of Delphi is just around the corner, as they are starting to talk about it with hints about new features. So far I’ve seen:
- [Looks like the IDE will be have more memory](http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/coming-soon-to-rad-studio-twice-the-ide-memory-brings-a-new-level-of-productivity-performance-and-stability) available to it.  That’s good new for those of us who work with multi-million line projects.- [iOS developers will be able to debug Universal 64-bit apps.](http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/coming-soon-to-rad-studio-ios-64-bit-universal-app-debugging)- [Support for Android Services](http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/coming-soon-to-delphi-execute-background-tasks-with-android-services)- You can sign up for a webinar that gives a sneak peak into the upcoming release.  It’s called “See What’s Coming in Delphi, RAD Studio, and C++Builder” and it is at various times during the day of 02 September.  [Register now](http://forms.embarcadero.com/RADFirstLookWebinar-2015-09-02).  
- I attended the webinar about [CodeSite](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/codesite) and the [Konopka Signature VCL controls](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/konopka-signature-vcl-controls) and was very impressed.  I knew the basics of CodeSite, but never really knew its full power.  And I hadn’t looked at the VCL controls in a while, either.  As I’ve said, Ray has forgotten more about good UI design than I’ll ever know, and his controls reflect that.  A couple of things to note from the webinar and the Q&A:
- Both CodeSite and the Konopka Signature controls will be sold as separate products and not ship as part of Delphi.  The limited-but-still-very-useful CodeSite Express will continue to ship with Delphi, RAD Studio, and C++Builder.- CodeSite also has a .Net version, so if you are doing Net development, you can use can use it there as well.  I like that Embarcadero is making a foray into the .Net world.  Maybe I’ll get really smart on CodeSite and give a CodeSite for .Net presentation at our next Philly code camp.  - It *appears*  that Ray will continue to work on both products, but that wasn’t 100% clear.- The fate of Ray’s [cool Radiant Shapes for FireMonkey](http://www.raize.com/devtools/RadiantShapes/Default.asp) wasn’t made entirely clear, but it was hinted that more news was coming on that front.  
- I’m a huge [FinalBuilder](www.finalbuilder.com) fan, and [the folks at VSoft have just released Version 8](https://www.finalbuilder.com/resources/blogs/postid/733/finalbuilder-8-released).  Sounds like a great release from a great product.

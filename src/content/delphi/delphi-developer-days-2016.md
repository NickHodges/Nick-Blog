I’m quite happy to announce that I’ll be part of [Delphi Developer Days](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com) with Cary Jensen this year.  I’m honored to be included, as DDD has long been a successful, interesting, and educational event.  I’m joining a list of distinguished Delphi speakers who have participated in the past. I’ve been to DDD a number of times and have always come away pleased that I went, so I’m glad to be on the delivering end this time. 

There will be four events this year:

- Chicago, USA: 14-15 November 2016 [Register](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/price_us.html)- Copenhagen, Denmark:  24-25 November 2016 [Register](file:///C:/Users/Nick/Downloads/price_europe.html)- Frankfurt, Germany: 28-29 November 2016 [Register](file:///C:/Users/Nick/Downloads/price_europe.html)- Baltimore, USA: 5-6 December 2016 [Register](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/price_us.html)
The complete agenda isn’t set yet, but we’ll get that out as soon as it is ready.  There is an “***Very ***Early Bird” discount  of 25% for folks who sign up before August 12th.

I’m really excited to do these events and so I hope that I see you there.

- Hey, we have a hotfix available for RAD Studio.  [It can be found on Code Central](http://cc.embarcadero.com/item/30764).  It focuses on some issues in the tool chain.  Given that it’s a hotfix, it only replaces a few choice files and doesn’t require an uninstall/reinstall process.  Thanks to everyone who filled out the RAD Studio survey.  We had a very good response, and we’ll pour over the results and make decisions based on what we learn from there.  Thanks. If you are an InterBase customer,  [the InterBase 2017 survey](https://delphiaball.co.uk/2017/04/20/interbase-developer-survey-2017/) is out and available. This is your chance to have your voice be heard on the InterBase front.  Jason Southwell is at it again. This time he has [an interesting framework called ConinAsync](https://bitbucket.org/sivv/cocinasync) that makes parallel programming with data structures really easy.  Give it a look.  A lot of folks have been asking when my new book, Dependency Injection in Delphi, will be available in physical form.  [Well, it’s available now on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2p3gb3Z).  I’m grateful to all of you who buy my books.

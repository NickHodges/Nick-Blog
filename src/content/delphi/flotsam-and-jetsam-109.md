- In the last Flotsam and Jetsam, I mentioned a few things that are leaking out about the next release of RAD Studio.  [Here's one I missed](http://community.embarcadero.com/write-blog-post/entry/coming-soon-to-rad-studio-enhanced-designer-experience?cid=701G0000000tKU2), about new stuff in the designer and the IDE.  Nice features.  And oh, [you can sign up for a webinar that looks like it will be showing all of this stuff](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/128685), including [a FireDAC driver for MongoDB](http://community.embarcadero.com/write-blog-post/entry/coming-soon-to-rad-studio-firedac-nosql-driver-for-mongodb).- [CodeRage X is coming soon -- October 13-15, 2015](http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage).  For sure sign up -- it is totally free -- and if you have an inkling, submit a presentation.  Never done a presentation before?  This is a great opportunity to do your first one.  The presentations are pre-recorded, so there's no need to be nervous in front of a crowd, and there's always room for a new voice in the community.  So come on, sign up to speak!  I believe that the Call for Papers ends September 4th.  - [I'll be attending and speaking at EKON 19 this year](http://entwickler-konferenz.de/2015/en) -- I always look forward to this event.  I'll be speaking on Operator Overloading, Dependency Injection, and Parallel Programming.  This is always a fun and well run event, and I'd love to see you there.  Sign up before October 1 for the Early Bird pricing.- I'll also be presenting two chapters from [my new book](http://www.morecodingindelphi.com) in two different upcoming Partner Spotlights.  [Please signup and attend](http://forms.embarcadero.com/15Q3TechPartnerSpotlights).  And remember, Delphi XE8 owners get a free copy of [More Coding in Delphi](http://www.morecodingindelphi.com). - [Here's an interesting link](http://sourceforge.net/p/radstudiodemos/code/HEAD/tree/branches/RADStudio_Seattle/) for you product naming conspiracy buffs.

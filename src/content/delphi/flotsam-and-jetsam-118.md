- Delphi for Linux is soon to be here.  We’ve unleashed the Beta Bloggers, so keep an eye out for more information coming from any number of sources.- Thanks to all of you who have bought my new book, [Dependency Injection in Delphi](https://leanpub.com/dependencyinjectionindelphi).  I’m grateful for all the support.  My wife is working on the cover for the paperback edition, and it should be available soon.- I’ve had a job change – I’m moving from being the Director of Product Management to the Director of Engineering.  Instead of managing the Product itself, I’ll be managing the actual development process for all the Embarcadero products, as well a couple of other [Idera](http://www.idera.com) tools.  It’s a bit of a switch, but one I’m looking forward to.  Managing the development process is no small task, but I feel up to the challenge.- I’ve always said that if I could teach new developers one thing, it would be to “***program to an abstraction, not to an implementation***”.  I was at a great talk on Code Reviews by Travis Laborde at a recent Philly Code Camp, and he said that that most important thing to teach a new developer was the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).  I thought that was a worthy competitor.  What do you think is the most important thing to teach to a new developer?

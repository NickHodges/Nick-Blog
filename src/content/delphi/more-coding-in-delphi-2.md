I hope most of you have heard by now, but my second book is out and it is called “[*More Coding in Delphi*](http://www.morecodingindelphi.com)”.   It’s a book very similar in nature to my first book (*[Coding in Delphi](http://www.codingindelphi.com/)*, which is still very much for sale) in that it covers coding techniques for Delphi Developers.  

[You can get the book for free if you own Delphi XE8](https://downloads.embarcadero.com/item/30323).  If you don’t yet own Delphi XE8, [I suggest you upgrade](http://www.embarcadero.com/radoffer), get the great product, and then get both my and [Marco’s new book](http://amzn.to/1h4gGmH) as well – both for free.  It’s a win all around.   Sorry, but the only way to get the ebook is to be a Delphi XE8 owner.  Well, I shouldn’t say sorry; as I said – it’s a win for everyone to own XE8.  

If you want a paperback copy of *More Coding in Delphi*, [you can buy it from CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com/5598794).  You can also buy it on Amazon, but you’ll be doing me a favor if you buy it from [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com/5598794) – my royalty is markedly bigger there.   CreateSpace is owned by Amazon if that makes a difference, and you’ll get the exact same book either way.

Here’s the Table of Contents of the main body of the book:

- Six Things Before We Start- Writing SOLID Code- Patterns
- Factory Pattern- Observer Pattern- Adapter Pattern- Decorator Pattern- Command Pattern
- Operator Overloading- Multi-Threading and Parallelism Overview- Using TThread
- The Parallel Programming Library- Parallel For Loops
- Interception and Aspect-oriented Programming- A History and Review of TSmiley

In addition, here are also Appendices about Duck Typing and “Things Nick Does When He Codes”.  

*More Coding in Delphi* was a lot of work, but well worth it. It’s quite satisfying to complete a book.  

I hope you like it.

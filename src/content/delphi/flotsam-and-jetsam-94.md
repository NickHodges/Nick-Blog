- **Blog of the Week**:  The blog of the week is Stefan Glienke’s [Delphi Sorcery](http://delphisorcery.blogspot.com/).  He is doing all kind of cool things, including bringing some of the interesting things found in functional programming over to Delphi.  His latest post is on [Either](http://delphisorcery.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-either-type-for-delphi.html) – a record that can be either one thing or another.  It’s similar to the [Maybe](http://delphisorcery.blogspot.com/2015/01/never-return-nil-maybe.html) record of his previous post.  Stefan is a leading light in the Delphi community (He runs the [Spring4D](http://www.spring4d.org) project), and we can all learn a lot from him.   I know I do.  [Plus he just posted this video showing how to integrate unit tests right into the IDE](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+StefanGlienke/posts/dD1a3nUaK9D?cfem=1).   How cool is that?- I think someone could make a lot of money writing a FireMonkey book.- [Delphi Week is coming](http://bit.ly/1zrIBBO).  You need to be ready. Be very ready.- The progress of the [Spring for Delphi Framework](http://www.spring4d.org) continues apace, under the leadership of the aforementioned Stefan Glienke.  The latest addition is a new Dynamic Array type that exceeds even the new functionality in the XE7 syntax.  I love using the Spring Framework, and consider it a part of the Delphi RTL. If you haven’t already done so you should [pull it from BitBucket](http://www.spring4d.com) and give it a look.- **Article and Quote of the Week:**  “[You should be able to extend the behavior of a system without having to modify that system](http://bit.ly/1uxZw1g).” – Uncle Bob Martin

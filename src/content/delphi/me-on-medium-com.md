Hey --

This blog is fun and I hope educational, but it reaches only a certain spectrum of the developer community -- that is, almost all of you are Delphi developers.  I'm grateful to every one of you that has read my blog and [bought my books](http://www.codingindelphi.com/), but I wanted to try to reach out to a broader audience with my writing.

So, I started writing on [medium.com](https://www.medium.com/). If you aren't familiar with Medium, then you might want to consider giving it a look.  Medium is a huge blogging platform, with many publications of all types.  It has both a free version and a paywall version, and the cost is a mere $5 a month. [ I started writing all different kinds of things](https://medium.com/@nickhodges) but was lucky enough to be picked up as a writer by [Better Programming](https://medium.com/better-programming).  I've published a number of different technical articles there, which are listed below.  I've managed to even make a little money via the Medium Partner Program.

Readers of my books will notice some of the content -- I've reused a lot of what I wrote in my books and published it for a non-Delphi crowd.  (Note that if there was code to show, I used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).)

Okay, so if you want to read my latest stuff on Medium, here's a list of links.  I'd be grateful if you gave a look at anything that you find interesting:

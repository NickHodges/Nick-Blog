- [Wallace and Gromit run on Delphi.](http://bit.ly/1GP1aWs)
	-  [I of course want you to buy my book](https://www.createspace.com/4584226), but I have been doing research for my next book and am thus reading sections of [Delphi XE2 Foundations](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477550895/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1477550895&linkCode=as2&tag=nickhodgeshomepa&linkId=JBCPSF3O3NHGLIRM)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nickhodgeshomepa&l=as2&o=1&a=1477550895).  I can’t recommend this book enough.  It’s a *tour de force* for Delphi and the RTL.  I know how hard it is to write a book, and I can’t imagine how much work this one took.  It’s excellent, and I highly recommend it (after you buy my book, of course….).  Don’t be put off by “XE2” in the title, this is a great book for all Delphi developers.  Kudos to Chris Rolliston.
	- I’ve never really gotten into [Quora](http://www.quora.com), but it seems like a pretty cool site which has somehow managed to produce quality questions and answers without all the spam and other nonsense that often attends such a site.  [Here’s a Quora question about Delphi](http://www.quora.com/Do-you-still-use-Delphi-to-code-your-applications-professionally-If-so-why-If-not-why-not) that many of you might like to answer and/or read about.
	- Yesterday, I tweeted the following:  “*Of all the types of reviews out there, the  ‘I couldn't understand it so it must really suck, 1 star’ reviews are my favorite.*” In researching my book, I’ve been re-reading [Dependency Injection in .NET](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935182501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1935182501&linkCode=as2&tag=nickhodgeshomepa&linkId=AXGZBIXESCB2JNWV)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nickhodgeshomepa&l=as2&o=1&a=1935182501)
 by [Mark Seemann](http://blog.ploeh.dk/).  I looked up the book on [Amazon](www.amazon.com), and was astonished to find that someone had given this amazing and enlightening book a 1-star review.  Some people, I swear.  [This review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZYUNQX2K62L/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935182501&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful) is more along the lines of what the book deserves.
	- **Correction:  **Apparently, it was Borland C++ 3.0 that was the big box with the handle.  Thanks for the correction from [Jeroen Pluimers](http://wiert.me/), who [also found a picture](http://www.steeletechproductions.com/sell/). (You have to scroll down a bit, but it’s there…)
	- **A Clarification:**  Two points to make on my last post about subscriptions.  First, it wasn’t about EMBT, but rather the software industry in general. Second, the point wasn’t “Software subscriptions are great!”, but rather “The industry is moving to subscriptions, and here’s why”.  Many folks seemed to believe I was arguing the former.  Perhaps I was just inarticulate.  Sorry for any confusion.

***Update in July, 2012***:  This series of articles was written using an early version of the framework.  Therefore, much of the code I posted might not compile or make sense.  But the lessons here are all still the same.

I have written a series of articles on Dependency Injection with the [Delphi Spring Framework](http://code.google.com/p/delphi-spring-framework/).  I've centralized them here:

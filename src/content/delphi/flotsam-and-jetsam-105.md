- Two things about Martin Harvey’s threading article that I posted.  First, Alexey Gavrilov was kind enough to send me version 1.1a, which I have posted.  Second, it turns out that [the article/book is available on CodeCentral](http://cc.embarcadero.com/Item.aspx?id=14809).  So if you want to download it for yourself, you can.  But now, at least, people can find it online.  - Embarcadero has put out [a pretty cool “commercial” on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSzD1VLJIyU).  I think it is very nicely done.  - There is a new Delphi book out:  [Cross-Platform Development with Delphi XE7 & Firemonkey for Windows & Mac OS X](http://amzn.to/1PSSROw) by Harry Stahl. Only a couple of reviews on Amazon – one good and one not. Thanks to Robert Dawson for pointing it out in the newsgroups.- Weird.  [Both Microsoft and Embarcadero are left off of this list](http://sdtimes.com/sdtimes-100/2015/best-in-show/alm-development-tools-2015/).

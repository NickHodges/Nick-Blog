- It’s [#Code2014](http://www.code2014.com/) time again! Time to tweet out what languages you used for the year.  Just list your languages and include the hashtag `#code2014`, and they’ll do the rest.  Of course, you can include Delphi all you want.  I won’t mind.- Looks like [Ray Konopka will be replacing Dr. Bob](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/122317) this coming year for [Delphi Developer Days](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/).  If you haven’t heard Ray speak, he’s excellent.  Really excellent. I’ve been to DDD three or four times, and it’s always great.  Adding Ray this year will maintain the high standards that it has always had.  Looks like Dr. Bob is just taking some time off from traveling, and Ray is stepping in.  Sounds great.  And as Cary notes in his blog post, you can get a reduced rate if you register early!  ![Smile](http://www.codingindelphi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wlEmoticon-smile.png)- [In a recent post](http://www.codingindelphi.com/blog/never-assume-your-paths-have-ending-delimiters/), I talked about `IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter` and why you should always use it with your path strings.  I should have mentioned that there is also a `ExcludeTrailingPathDelimiter` that is part of the RTL, too, which does what it says – takes off the trailing path delimiter if it is there.  I’m not sure why you’d want to do that, but hey, there it is.  - Happy New Year, everyone.  I hope that 2015 has everything in it that you want and hope for.  In case you were wondering, my New Years Resolutions are to finish my new book and 1920x1080.

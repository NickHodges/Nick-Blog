- A little while ago, I wrote [an article on VSoft’s command line arguments library](http://www.nickhodges.com/post/Another-Gem-from-the-VSoft-Guys-TCommandLineParser.aspx).  Since then, I’ve discovered a couple of other solutions that might be of interest.  First is from John Kaster, TCommandParser, which has [an EDN article](http://edn.embarcadero.com/print/40404) (it’s mentioned in there, don’t worry) and [a CodeCentral entry](http://cc.embarcadero.com/item/27574).  [Primož Gabrijelčič](https://plus.google.com/109828045030741886977) has created [one that uses attributes.](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/122178)  And [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/835573/is-there-an-implementation-of-getopt-for-delphi) has a number of other solutions as well.  - Speaking of command line parameters, how about someone create a default Console Application that has command line processing built right into it.  You could go “File|New|Console Application” and have a new console application with command-line options.  Maybe there could even be a wizard to define the command line parameters that your console application would have.  Just and idea – I don’t have the time to do it right now.  :-)- A while back, [Marco](http://www.marcocantu.com) posted about [the “TurboPack”,](http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2014-october-turbopack-xe7.html) a set of open source libraries over which Embarcadero appears to be taking ownership.  I was glad to see [SynEdit](http://sourceforge.net/p/syneditnew/code/ci/default/tree/) on that list, as I use that in an app I built, and have always found its varying versions confusing.  I hope EMBT is able to tighten that up.  Anyway, [Marco now has a short video on his blog](http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2014-december-turbopack-short-video.html) that demonstrates some of these components working.  Nothing big, just a quick look.  I think this is a good initiative on EMBT’s part, and so it would be good for those of you that agree to show support as well.  You can find links to the code on [Roman Kassebaum’s blog](http://blog.kassebaum.eu/?p=379). I guess we owe Roman a Thank You as I bet he did most of the work.- Clearly the focus of the last few releases of RAD Studio have been on mobile development. Some folks have complained that the VCL developer has been left behind.  It seems that EMBT has been aware of this feeling, and has been emphasizing that it isn’t true – that there have been quite a few developments for VCL developers, including REST client components (which are remarkably easy to use), app tethering, taskbar components, the Parallel Library, [and more](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/122116).  They also have a webinar coming up entitled “[Modernize Your VCL Applications Today](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/122107)”.  Yes, the focus hasn’t been 100% on the VCL as in days gone by, but the VCL hasn’t been ignored by any means.  Quite the contrary.- **Book I’m Reading**:  [Object Thinking](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735619654&linkCode=as2&tag=nickhodgeshomepa&linkId=77W6GZXX7PAETNAN)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nickhodgeshomepa&l=as2&o=1&a=0735619654) by David West.  The idea here is that even though we are all using OOP languages now, we are really doing procedural programming inside the world of OOP.  West discusses how we need to start thinking totally differently about our code – to think about objects.  Interesting so far – not your typical coding book.

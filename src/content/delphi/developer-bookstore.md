This is a list of books that I think that every developer should read.

Let me know if you think a book should be added to this list.  

BookDiscussion

## Coding in Delphi by Nick Hodges (Me!)
I naturally think everyone should read my own book.

## Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
This is the definitive book on how to organize and write your code.  Uncle Bob Martin is passionate and to the point.  He pulls no punches.  But if you read and heed this book, your code will be, well, clean. 

## Code Complete 2 By Steve McConnell
Probably one of the first books on the topic of writing good code. Clearly a classic.  I read the original version years ago, and this update version is even better.

## The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
Not a book about coding directly, but more about the craft of coding.  I don't like to call developers "engineers" because I don't think that is what we do.  Rather, as the cover of this book suggests, we are craftsman, and this book helps you develop your craft so that you can become a Master Craftsman.

## Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers
This may be the most useful book here. Many of us have the task of taking over an older code base that wasn't exactly written by Uncle Bob. This book shows you effective techniques for modernizing and cleaning up that code.

## Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler et al.
If you aren't refactoring your code, then you are sticking with your first attempt at things. Like a well written article, code needs to be rewritten -- refactored -- as well. The inestimable Martin Fowler shows you how.

## Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and  John Vlissides 
Often known as the "Gang of Four Book", it describes the design patterns that we all should be using to write our code. Definitive, classic, and a must read.

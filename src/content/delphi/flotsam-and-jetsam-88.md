- The inestimable [Malcolm Groves](http://www.malcolmgroves.com/blog/) has a [nice series going on the new Delphi Parallel Library](http://www.malcolmgroves.com/blog/?cat=109).  Recommended reading.
	- I put a tag cloud over there on the left.  Now I just have to remember to put tags on all my posts.
	- I welcome feedback on the new blog.  As I said, my goal is to keep the blog as simple and clean as possible and the content as interesting and useful as possible.
	- I guess I should have realized that such a thing would exist, but [I just found the Delphi Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/delphi/).  Thanks to folks that post my blog entries there.
	- Another entry in the “How did I miss this?” department:  A guy named Branko Stojakovic has built [a blog covering most of the Gang of Four patterns](http://delphipatterns.blog.com/).  Maybe I did mentioned this before – I have a dim memory of it – but anyway, worth looking at and learning from either way.

- My friends David Millington and Roman Yankovsky have teamed up to offer a Christmas time special.  You can buy both of their tools for the price of [Fix Insight](http://sourceoddity.com/fixinsight/).  What are those tools?  Well, David’s tool is [Navigator](https://parnassus.co/delphi-tools/parnassus-navigator/) – a powerful, easy to use way to navigate your code.  Roman’s tool is [Fix Insight](http://sourceoddity.com/fixinsight/) – a static code analysis tool.  Right now, you can get both for the price of Fix Insight – that’s a $40 in savings.  I can vouch for both tools as being very useful and of high quality.  Don’t miss this good chance to get two excellent tools at a low price.  (While you are at [David’s website](https://parnassus.co/), be sure to download the excellent and free [Bookmarks](https://parnassus.co/delphi-tools/bookmarks/) plugin. And did you know that [he has some open source items available as well](https://parnassus.co/open-source/)?)- ‘Tis the season for Delphi updates.  Of course, [Delphi 10 Seattle Update 1 is out](https://downloads.embarcadero.com/reg/delphi).  It even includes [a few new features](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/130724).  It is available for all people on Update Subscription.  (For those of you complaining about this, I hate to say it, but you were given plenty of warning and opportunities to get on board.)  [Dr. Bob reports on two hot fixes that are also available](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/130731). - It looks like I’m going to be speaking in Denmark in April at [DAPUG’s](http://www.dapug.dk/) annual conference.  I have spoken twice before, and have always enjoyed my trips there, and the fine hospitality provided by Jens Fudge and his family.  I’m looking forward to speaking there again.  Not 100% sure what the topics will be yet, but I promise it will be interesting. - I had a great time at [EKON 19](http://entwickler-konferenz.de/2015/en) – you should attend next year no matter where you are in the world – and the thing I enjoyed the most was my three hour seminar on Dependency Injection.  I covered Dependency Injection in *Coding in Delphi,*  but things have changed in the mean time, and there have been additions to the [Spring for Delphi framework](http://www.spring4d.org) that make things even more powerful and capable.  So much so, in fact, that I’ve decided to write a book entitled [Dependency Injection in Delphi](https://leanpub.com/dependencyinjectionindelphi)**. It will very likely be shorter than my other two books, and I think to start I’ll sell it as an ebook only (MOBI, ePub, and PDF) on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/).  It will, however, go into Dependency Injection much more in depth than my two chapters in *[Coding in Delphi](https://leanpub.com/codingindelphi)*.   In any event, you can follow [this link](https://leanpub.com/dependencyinjectionindelphi) and sign up for updates about  the book and let me know how much you think I should charge for it.  There’s absolutely no time table on this – as you saw above, I have a lot of preparation to do for DAPUG – but I will be working on it.  I’ll go with “it will be available later this year”.  Again, I’m humbled and grateful by all the people who have bought my books.

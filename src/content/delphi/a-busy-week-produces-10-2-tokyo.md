“Shipping is a feature” is one of my favorite sayings.  In fact, I’d argue that shipping is the most important feature, because without it, you don’t get any other features.  

But shipping is a lot of work – as this past week proved.  On Wednesday, we shipped RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo, and we got it done two days earlier than we originally planned.  (Here’s a hint from the time we did it with Delphi 2007 and I spent the entire weekend helping customers with issues – never ship on a Friday).  Anyway, we worked hard and shipped on Wednesday, and it all worked out.

So, have you tried Tokyo yet?  [If you haven’t, hop on over and give it a whirl](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/start-for-free).  I’ll wait.  

Okay, now that you’ve tried it out, [you can get a good deal until the end of the month](https://www.embarcadero.com/app-development-tools-store/rad-studio).  Definitely worth seriously considering. 

My [favorite of the new features](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/whats-new-in-10-2-tokyo) is the Linux support,  but I’m guessing many of you are, like me, Windows people and aren’t that familiar with how things work on the Linux side of things.  However, things aren’t that difficult.  To get started, I recommend that you read and follow [this excellent (and startlingly detailed) blog post by Craig Chapman](http://chapmanworld.com/2016/12/29/configure-delphi-and-redhat-or-ubuntu-for-linux-development/).  It should get your Linux all set up and ready to run.  You’ll even get a sample application running in the debugger.

Linux support brings to five the number of platforms that Delphi supports.  It’s a list of familiar names --  Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, and now Linux.  Delphi (and soon C++ for Linux) takes you where ever you need to go.  One codebase, natively compiled on  your favorite operating system.  We’ve come a long way from the days of just supporting WIndows, eh?

- [Delphi XE7 Update 1 is available](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/XE7/en/Release_Notes_for_XE7_Update_1).  Nice. The release notes have the link to where you can get it.    - I’d like to thank the great staff at EKON 18 for a great conference and a great trip.  It was fun (despite the fact that I lost my phone and felt like a lost puppy without it).  The conference was interesting, and I got to see old friends like [Ray Konopka](www.raize.com), [Cary Jensen and Loy Anderson](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/), [Marco Cantu](http://www.marcocantu.com), and [Sebastian Gingter](http://gingter.org/).  It was a great conference, and I was honored to be a speaker.  Thanks to everyone who came to my talks.    - I also presented at another great [CodeRage](http://www.embarcadero.com/fr/coderage).  I talked on enumerators and IEnumerable from the [Delphi Spring Framework](http://www.spring4d.org).   [The replays are available online](http://www.embarcadero.com/fr/coderage/coderage-9-op-sessions) – or at least many of them are as they post them. I see that currently mine isn’t – I think that’s because I have to redo the Q&A portion.  Stay tuned.    - **Book Update:**  An e-book version of [Coding in Delphi](http://www.codingindelphi.com/) is available to you free – [all you have to do is activate the trial of XE7](http://www.delphifeeds.com/go/s/121584).  Good deal, eh?- Apparently Delphi had a small but important role in the ESA Rosetta Project – you know, that spacecraft that actually landed on a comet.  Pretty cool.  ** **

[Gateway Ticketing](http://www.gatewayticketing.com/) is hiring. Things are going really well, and we need to expand what we are doing. We are [looking for developers](http://bit.ly/qfS99j) -- Delphi developers specifically, but we are mostly interested in smart people that know what they are doing when developing high-quality software.  We love Delphi and C#, but in the end, those are just languages and we know that it doesn’t ultimately matter what tool you know, but whether you really know how to ***[write clean code](http://amzn.to/r3cAip).***

Here are some reasons why you should consider working for Gateway Ticketing:

- **We are a great place to work**.  I love it here.  We have a great group of people and a great culture. - **We are serious about being serious about software development**.  We aren’t messing around here.  While we have a large legacy code base, we are all about doing the right thing the right way with the right tools.  We insist on unit tests for your code.  We insist that you keep up with the latest innovations in writing code.  We insist that you view coding the same way that [Rembrandt viewed painting.](http://bit.ly/rfMxfW)   We are not messing around here.- **We love Delphi**, and we live and  breathe it here.  We are doing cool things like using the [Delphi Spring Framework](https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d/src/master/) and other fun stuff.- **We are writing RESTful APIs** to build the ticketing system of the future.- We use C# and ASP.NET for our eCommerce solution and all the cool stuff that goes along with that.- We are located in beautiful [Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gilbertsville,_Pennsylvania).  This a great place to live and raise a family.  We are close to everything but have that great small town feel.  I love living here, and you will too.- **Our customers are some of the greatest and most fun places on earth**.  We sell systems to the largest amusement parks, zoos, water parks, and museums all over the world.  This is a cool industry.  Who doesn’t love a good amusement park?

Okay, look – everyone says they want to hire “rock-star developers”.  That’s all well and good, but the bottom line is that we are setting our standards really high.  And if doing that scares people off, well so be it.  We don’t want people who are scared off by high standards.  We want people who are ***looking ***for places with high standards.  [We expect and demand your very best – anything less and you should find a job writing VB code](http://youtu.be/rjRxdrg9BtU). We really are creating a world-class place to build software, and we want folks like you to be a part of it.  You are up for that, right?

And of course, here are the obligatory caveats. Naturally, you must be eligible to work in the United States.  Relocation assistance is available. ***Remote work within the US is available for the right candidate. *** We don’t care where you are from or who your parents were or what color your dog is or anything like that.  We are really only interested in what you can do.  And of course, we want you to know what we can do for you, too.

Sorry, we cannot sponsor H1B visas.

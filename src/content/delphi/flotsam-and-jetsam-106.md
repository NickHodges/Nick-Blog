- [Number 10 with a bullet!](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)- As you may have noticed [on my LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickhodges), I am once again an employee at [Gateway Ticketing](http://www.gatewayticketing.com).  This time around, I am a Senior Software Developer, meaning I am full-time Delphi Developer.  I’m delighted to be back in the new beautiful building that Gateway has built.  I’m also pleased to have shaved an hour off of my commute each way.  I enjoyed my time at [Veeva Systems](http://www.veeva.com), but the prospect of returning to Gateway and reducing my commute was just too much to resist.- Why did Borland fail?  [Danny Thorpe gave an answer on Quora](http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Borland-fail/answer/Danny-Thorpe?share=1&), and [it is being discussed on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9712267).- The inestimable [Julian Bucknall has released is well-known EZDSL data structure library](http://blog.boyet.com/blog/blog/open-sourcing-ezdsl-on-github/) at [GitHub](https://github.com/jmbucknall/EZDSL).  Thanks, Julian!- **Book Update**:  As many of you know, I’m working on a new book called, naturally, “[More Coding in Delphi](https://leanpub.com/morecodingindelphi)” and I thought I’d give you an update on it.  The whole book is written, and it’s going to be a little longer than “[Coding in Delphi](http://www.codingindelphi.com/)”.  It’s now in that really hard stage where you have to read it and read it and update it and change the demos and fix things and do all the millions of little things that it takes to finish things up.  In other words it’s in the “The last 20% takes 80% of the time” mode.  But don’t worry, as I type this I’m sitting at Burger King getting ready to plow into things and “git ‘er done”.

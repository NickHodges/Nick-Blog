- We have a vibrant .Net community here in the Eastern Pennsylvania/Philadelphia area.  [Philly.Net](https://phillydotnet.org/) runs events once or twice a month at the Microsoft campus, and semi-annual Code Camps that are usually attended by well over 700 people.  I attend whenever I can.  But I’ve noticed something interesting over the last year or two:  almost all the coding topics are now Javascript-based.  I see them doing very few C# – based presentations.  [This event is pretty typical](http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=bbdb23ff2172e753a70be78a9&id=49b224a4c6&e=5bc024e385).  (I am going to be attending this one, by the way…..) Anyway, just an observation that I think is interesting.
	- If you aren’t satisfied with the RAD Studio IDE’s bookmarking system – and you shouldn’t be as it leaves a lot to be desired – you might be interested in the free [IDE plugin called Parnassus Bookmarks](http://parnassus.co/delphi-tools/bookmarks/) from David Millington.  It works great, is totally free, and is a solid replacement for the existing system.   Download and install is recommended.
	- Well, Delphi has done really well in the [#Code2014](http://www.code2014.com) survey.  Thanks to everyone who tweeted.  It’s nice to see Delphi up near the top in a very respectable position.  As of this writing, Delphi is only 19 tweets behind C++ – nothing to blow your nose at.    Javascript continues to dominate in a pretty big way, nearly doubling the second place Python.  (See my comment above).
	- **New Project of the Week:  **Another gem from the inestimable Malcolm Groves – [TStateMachine](https://github.com/malcolmgroves/TStateMachine).  From the README:  “*TStateMachine is a framework for declaring and running state machines in Delphi. It supports generic types for states and triggers, anonymous methods for Guards and Effects (State.OnEntry? and State.OnExit?), and a Fluid interface for configuring the State Machine.*”  Very interesting and worth a look.  Maybe even worth a new chapter in my book.
	- Cary and Ray have set the agenda for their [Delphi Developer Days conference](http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/).  Again, this is always a high-quality event, and I try to make it every year.  Word of advice: Don’t ever miss Ray Konopka when he is speaking.  He’s very, very good.

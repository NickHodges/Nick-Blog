- Well, the next release of Delphi must be getting close.  [The Delphi Insider has information about Skill Sprints that will show some of the new features](http://delphi-insider.blogspot.com/2015/03/early-looks-at-next-version-of-rad.html).  Mitov Software has an [interesting screen shot that looks like it has some sort of multi-view for mobile apps](http://labpacks.blogspot.com/2015/03/a-sneak-preview-of-upcoming-new-version.html).  Cool.  Here’s a community post [on what it is – the Multi-device Preview](http://community.embarcadero.com/index.php/blogs/entry/an-inside-look-at-the-all-new-upcoming-multi-device-preview?cid=701G0000000tP05).  The Code Sprint are showing off new features as well.  [Marco has a video about EMS Notifications](http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2015-march-push-notifications-ems-preview.html).  EMS is a very under-appreciated feature if you ask me.  - I endeavor to write clean code. I hope you do, too.  One nice measure of that the Embarcadero has given us is “Can Castalia properly parse your code?”.  I submit the following statement:  If Castalia has trouble parsing your code, then the first place you should look to solve the problem is in your code. Code that gives Castalia – [which has a pretty good parser](https://github.com/jacobthurman/Castalia-Delphi-Parser) – a hard time is maybe just a touch over complicated or not well formatted.  Just a thought. Just my personal thought.- Yesterday I attended the Philly.Net Code Camp.  There were at least 500 people there, including a larger percentage of women than I’ve seen before – or at least it seemed that way to me.  I spent the entire day in the same room on the “Scripting” track, learning about [node.js](https://nodejs.org/),  “this” in Javascript, more about what [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is, and what is coming in ECMAScript 6.  It was a good time and I learned a lot.  These events occur twice a year, and the [Philly.net](https://phillydotnet.org/) crew do an amazing job putting the event together.  Did I mention that these events  are ***totally free***?  I’ve spoken at the event in the past, mostly on non-technical topics.  I’ll try to do that for the next one.  In any event, it was a good event.  If you are in the area (people came from as far as New York), I’d recommend it.  - I’m plugging away on my next book.  Two areas that are giving me – ahem – “challenges” are the Parallel Library and MVVM.  Coming up with good examples leads the difficulty.  Just getting my head around all the stuff in the Parallel Library is proving difficult, I must confess.  I don’t want to do any code with `Sleep` in it, so finding a good example of code that take up time is hard.  MVVM is proving difficult to find a good example using LIve Bindings, and actually doing the “true” MVVM way [as defined by Rob Eisenberg](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX10/EX15). I also have to get this chapter past Stefan Glienke, too. Hehe.   In any event, I promise by the time I publish, you’ll have a good solid chapter or two on those subjects that will make you smarter for reading them.  - As I mentioned above, I’d like to learn Typescript, mainly because you can apparently ***not*** have to learn many of the vagaries of Javascript while being able to achieve the same result.  However, Amazon seems a little thin on books. Anyone got any good resources for Typescript?  I found some good resources for node.js, the avenue that I want to approach Javascript from, but the resources on Typescript are a bit lacking.

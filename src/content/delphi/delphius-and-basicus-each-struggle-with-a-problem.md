Delphius and Basicus were both working on problems.  Delphius was trying to fix his roof, and Basicus was trying to repair his front door.    Both found their problem difficult.

 Delphius was unable to come  up with a good solution for his problem.  After a brief time of contemplating, he decided to ask his neighbor Pascala what he should do.  

 Pascala was a wise woman and gave Delphius some sage advice that soon led to a sound and solid repair of Delphius’ roof.

 Basicus spent the the day frustrated, working on his front door by himself, and eventually came up with a fix that made things worse, would soon fail, and would eventually require paying a tradesmen to fix.

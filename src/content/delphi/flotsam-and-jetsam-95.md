- Last week I sang the praises of Stefan Glienke.  Well, he has done it again.  [He’s released TestInsight](http://delphisorcery.blogspot.com/2015/02/testinsight-unit-testing-like-pro.html) – an IDE integration for unit testing.  This is really cool – you can run your tests automatically right in the IDE.  Give it a look – very, very nice stuff.   Plus, it works with all the major unit testing frameworks. - **Tweet and Quote of the Week:**  “[As long as managers think programmers are young interchangeable pizza-fed cheaply hired commodities, buggy software will rule the world](https://twitter.com/LocalJoost/status/561465886645956608).”- Glad to see that this website is still alive and kicking: http://www.isdelphidead.com/ Hehe.- Work on my new book continues apace.  I’ve just started showing chapters to my “beta testers”.  I’m grateful for all the feedback I get.  If you are interested in reading rough drafts of my chapters, you can join the [Coding in Delphi](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110978417023349293804?cfem=1) group.  It’s a private group, so I’ll have to approve your entry, but that’s usually not a problem.  I welcome and am grateful for any help in making the book better.- Next week is [Delphi Week](http://community.embarcadero.com/index.php/article/news/1107-delphiweek2015).  You can register to participate.   Hard to believe it’s been twenty years.  Seriously?  Great that the product is still rolling along as strong as ever.  I’ll have few thoughts, tweets, and other things to offer as we celebrate.  Keep an eye on this space and the #delphiweek hashtag, as well as the presentations from Embarcadero.  Should be fun.- Jim McKeeth does a [nice interview with Darren Kosinski](http://delphi.org/2015/02/interview-with-darren-kosinski/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DelphiDotOrg+%28Delphi.org%29), who is a member of the FireMonkey R&D team.  Darren is a friend of mine from my days at Embarcadero and a good guy as well as a brilliant developer.  Give it a listen.

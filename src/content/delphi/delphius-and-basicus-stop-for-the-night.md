Delphius and Basicus were on a long journey, requiring several days travel.

They stopped for the night at a campsite beside the trail.  It had obviously been used as a campsite previously, as there were many signs of previous inhabitants.

Delphius and Basicus made camp and slept comfortably, for their journey was long and they were tired.

In the morning, Delphius began cleaning up the remains left by previous users of the site.  

“Why are you cleaning up another’s mess, Delphius.  They should have done it.  Why are you doing it?” said Basicus.

“Because someone else will want to use this site in the future, and we should do what we can for those future residents,” said Delphius.  “Those residents might even be us on the return journey.”

Delphius and Basicus continued on their journey.  Basicus remained puzzled, but Delphius knew the wisdom of his actions.

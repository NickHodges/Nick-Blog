The Internet has many benefits, and one of the best is the ability to learn from people that you might not ordinarily learn from. In the past, if you wanted to learn from someone, you pretty much had to read their books. That is great, of course, but now, with blogs, podcasts, social media and a hundred other ways, many wise people have a lot of good stuff to say that would neve have ended up in a book. Below are some folks that I follow and try to read everything that they write, and listen to everything that they say.

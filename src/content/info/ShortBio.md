I’m Nick Hodges. I’m a Software Developer Advocate, a friend, a Dad, a Grandfather, a former Naval Officer, a writer, and an aspiring web developer.

Despite having lived all over the world, I still consider myself a Minnesotan. I root for Minnesota sports teams, still, and I go back whenever I can. My Dad and brother still live there. As I like to brag every chance I get, my [sister served as Mayor of Minneapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Hodges). It’s a wonderful place.

I like to read books, hike, hang with friends, write in my journal, travel, and take long walks on the beach. (Okay, that last part is a joke…except it is true….)

I love fountain pens, a good solid journal to write in, basketball (particularly the NBA), Diet Coke (I know, I know…), a good ribeye steak, minimalism, my Tesla, a nice pair of leather boots, jeans, polo shirts, a lively debate, and baby elephants.
